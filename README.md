## Picsum Downloader

### Installation

~~Go to the release page and download the executable as per your operating system/cpu architecture.~~
For now, please build from source. Github actions need to be updated for linux and macos builds.

#### Build from source
To build from source, you must have rustc and cargo available on your machine.
If you don't have it installed, check [Rustup Docs](https://rustup.rs/) to get started.

Then, follow the steps below:

- `git clone https://github.com/aashan10/picsum.git`
- `cd picsum && cargo build -r`

After that, you'll have a release binary inside `<project-dir>/target/release/picsum` (`<project-dir>/target/release/picsum.exe` on windows).

On unix based systems, you can move the generated binary to `/usr/local/bin` or set up appropriate `PATH` environment variable in order to run the `picsum` command.

### Usage
```bash
